<p> <strong> Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) </strong> are distributional regression models, where all the parameters of the assumed distribution for the response can be modeled as additive functions of the explanatory variables. The GAMLSS models can be created with various distributions and different additive terms for smoothing. They are parametric, in that they require a parametric distribution assumption for the response variable, and “semi” in the sense that the modelling of the parameters involve non-parametric smoothing functions. The GAMLSS models can be created with various distributions and different additive terms for smoothing. The package gamlss is used for the Age-dependent Reference Intervals, where six different additive terms are used: P-Splines, Cubic Splines, Polynomials (Degree 3 and 4), Neural Networks and Decision Trees. The models create different functions, g stands for link-functions and h for the smooth methods for each parameter (µ = mean, σ = standard deviation, ν = skewness, τ = kurtosis): <br/><br/>

g1(µ) = h1(µ) <br/>
g2(σ) = h2(σ) <br/>
g3(ν) = h3(ν) <br/>
g4(τ) = h4(τ) <br/><br/>

Different models can be compared with the Pseudo R^2, AIC, BIC or GAIC(3) and can be visually evaluated. The centiles are calculated with the family distribution and the function quantile function in R. After fitting the GAMLSS models, the residuals can be calculated and can be removed to delete possible outliers from the data. The GAMLSS model can predict new reference values for GAMLSS models. The predicted GAMLSS models can be used to make discrete models, the deviation of the upper/lower Reference Intervals is calculated and split with a given threshold. This age-groups are used to calculate the percentiles, to make it easy to save the reference intervals in the laboratory systems. (Stasinopoulos, Dm & Rigby, Robert. (2007).

The semi-parametric <strong>LMS</strong> method was developed by Cole and Green in 1992 for fitting the age to a response variable in order to create centile curves. The form of the LMS Model is Y ~ D(µ, σ, ν, τ) and will automatic find the best fit for this three distributions: Box-Cox Cole & Green Distribution "BCCGo" (<strong>LMS</strong>), Box-Cox Power Exponential Distribution "BCPEo" (<strong>LMSP</strong>) or Box-Cox t-Distribution "BCTo" (<strong>LMST</strong>) and smooth it with P-Splines. These are commonly used to calculate percentile curves for growth reference curves for children and adolescents such as by World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) Group.
